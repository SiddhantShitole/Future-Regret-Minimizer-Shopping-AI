### 🚀 Future-Regret Minimizer Shopping AI

An AI-powered full-stack web application that predicts post-purchase regret probability before checkout and suggests lower-risk alternatives based on user financial behavior.

## 🧠 Overview

Many consumers regret purchases due to:

✔ Budget overspending

✔ Impulse buying

✔ Spending pattern deviation

✔ Frequent return behavior

This system predicts REGRETS risk before checkout and provides actionable recommendations. You can also check wether it is needed or not.

PyTorch TorchScript Model

## Why Separate ML Backend?

Serverless platforms do not support full PyTorch runtime

Enables scalable microservice design

Follows industry AI deployment standards

## ⚙️ Running Locally

1️⃣ Start ML Inference Server

cd ml-inference
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

## 2️⃣ Start Frontend

From project root:

pnpm dev


## 🔍 How It Works

User enters product and financial details

Frontend sends request to backend

FastAPI loads TorchScript model

Model predicts regret metrics

Outputs are bounded between 0–100

UI displays risk meter and recommendation

## 🎯 Use Cases

● Smart e-commerce checkout assistant

● Financial wellness applications

● Impulse buying prevention

● Behavioral spending analytics

## 🚀 Future Improvements

⇒ Supabase user behavior storage

⇒ Personalized regret modeling

⇒ ONNX optimization

⇒ LLM-generated explanations

⇒ Real product API integration

## 🏆 Highlights

✔ Full-stack AI integration

✔ Real ML training pipeline

✔ TorchScript production deployment

✔ Microservice architecture

✔ Zero-budget scalable setup

✔ AMD ROCm compatible
